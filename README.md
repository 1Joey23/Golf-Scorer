Thanks for checking out my golf project! This project was created for the final in my Intro To Programming class.

To run the project, navigate to the main.py file, click view terminal, and run the project.

A prompt will appear asking for a name for the golfer, and the project will ask your score for every hole and repeat the information to you.
Upon completion of data for all 18 holes, the GolfCourseOutput.csv file will reflect all of the inputted data.
